AS3MemoryManager is a component which allows you to check the memory level (and fps) in your Adobe Flash application.
It consists of one single static class. When added to stage, stays at the top of any other display object. It was created to be small and, when possible, costless to cpu resources.

The memory chart has three different lines:
* blue line: minimum memory.
* red line: maximum memory.
* green line: current memory.

At the simplest scenario one can initiate the component doing the following call:
